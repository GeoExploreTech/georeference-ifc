IFC is an open standard for exchanging Building Information Models (BIM).
This notebook shows how IFC files can be georeferenced by providing **7 parameters** that are part of the IFC standard but are usually omitted.
REAThese parameters make it easier to **combine BIM and geospatial data** (e.g. cadastral parcel data, 3D city models, point cloud data, or a digital elevation model) and enable use cases such as urban planning, evaluation of building permits or asset management.
