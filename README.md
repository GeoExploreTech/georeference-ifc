IFC files are an open standard for exchanging Building Information Models (BIM) that contain geometric and non-geometric information about constructions.
This notebook shows how IFC files can be georeferenced by providing **7 parameters** that are part of the IFC standard but are often omitted.
The use of these parameters will make it a lot easier to **combine BIM and geospatial data** (e.g. cadastral parcel data, 3D city models, point cloud data, or a digital elevation model).
This enables many use cases in areas such as construction planning, environmental permits, or asset management.
